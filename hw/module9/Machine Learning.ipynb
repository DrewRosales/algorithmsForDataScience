    "In the lecture notes we have discussed many types of Machine Learning algorithms and how to implement them. An important next step in understand models is to diagnose and address issues with the model performance. Validation curves are a powerful tool in the machine learning workflow, helping to diagnose and address issues like overfitting, underfitting, and the adequacy of the dataset size. Understanding how these curves work can guide you in making informed adjustments to your model."

    "__Validation curves__ plot training and validation scores (such as accuracy, F1 score, etc.) against varying values of a model parameter or the number of training examples. This graphical representation helps in understanding how changes in the model's complexity or the training set size affect its performance."

    "__Overfitting__ occurs when a model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data (validation set). In a validation curve, overfitting is indicated when the training score is high but the validation score is significantly lower, especially as the model complexity increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Underfitting__ is when a model cannot capture the underlying pattern of the data, resulting in poor performance on both the training and validation datasets. On a validation curve, underfitting is shown by both training and validation scores being low but possibly converging at a point of low complexity."

You may want to reduce the dataset by some factor to help with processing speed. Ensure you have a representative set and account for both the $X$ and $y$ values. "
