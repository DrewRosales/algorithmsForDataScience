Note, however, that each student is required to write up their solutions individually for all problems in their respective submission. Furthermore, to receive credit for a collaboration problem, each student in the collaboration group must actively and substantially contribute to the collaboration. This implies that no single student should post a complete solution to any problem at the beginning of the collaboration process."
