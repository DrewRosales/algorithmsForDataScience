    "* Insertion sort starts by using the 1st indice as a pivot then loops to the end of the list (nth indice). This yields n-1 operations for the initial for loop.\n",

    "* Sorting\n",
    "* So, given there are n values iterated through the for loop and 'n' possible comparisons for the pivot, the worst case for insertion sort is O(n^2). The worst case occurs when there is a reverse sorted list that requires the most amount of swaps.\n",
    "* However, assuming a fully sorted list, the algorithm iterates through the n-times with the for loop, will not fulfill the conditions on the while loop. Thus, the best case is Ω(n).\n",
